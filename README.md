This project is a deep learning-based web application that identifies traffic signs from uploaded images. The model achieves high accuracy (99%) and is built using TensorFlow/Keras.
The user-friendly interface is powered by Streamlit and includes features like custom logos and backgrounds for an enhanced user experience
Features:
~Upload an image of a traffic sign and get instant predictions.
~Displays the predicted traffic sign class along with the confidence score.
~Supports custom logos and background images for a personalized experience.
~Real-time error handling for unsupported file types or invalid inputs.
Future Enhancements:
Add support for real-time traffic sign detection from videos or live camera feeds.
Expand the dataset for better recognition of non-German traffic signs.
Deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
   Thank you for being over here!

 Note: I have provided some sample traffic sign images due to storage limitations.
